# Levels

## Overview
This repository explores Hans Rosling's data outlined in his book Factfulness. Rosling challenged traditional views of global income and development by dividing the world into four income levels instead of using outdated classifications like "developed" and "developing." This repository contains the code, data, and visualizations used in my analysis of income, health, and lifestyle distribution across these levels.
