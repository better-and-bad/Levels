# Levels

## Overview
This repository explores Hans Rosling's concept of Levels as outlined in his book Factfulness. Rosling challenged traditional views of global income and development by dividing the world into four income levels instead of using outdated classifications like "developed" and "developing." This repository contains the code, data, and visualizations used in my analysis of income, health, and lifestyle distribution across these levels.

## Contents
levels_to_it.R: The primary R script used for analysis and visualizations.
data/levels_data.xlsx: The data file containing global income and lifestyle metrics categorized by levels.
README.md: This file, explaining the purpose of the project and usage instructions.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone the repository:

R
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "readxl", "writexl"))
Load the Data: The Excel file levels_data.xlsx is included in the data/ directory. You can load it into R using the readxl package:

Country: Name of the country
Level: Income level (1 to 4)
Population: Population size for each level
Income_Per_Capita: Average income per capita
Life_Expectancy: Average life expectancy
Health_Expenditure: Average health expenditure per capita
Save Data to Excel
If you'd like to export the processed data back to an Excel file, you can use the following snippet:


Global Distribution Across Levels: A bar chart showing the share of the global population at each level.
Income vs. Life Expectancy: A scatterplot highlighting the relationship between income per capita and life expectancy.
Health Expenditure by Level: A stacked bar chart displaying health expenditure for each level.
About Factfulness
Hans Roslingâ€™s Factfulness emphasizes the importance of data-driven insights over outdated perspectives. By shifting focus from binary classifications to levels, it challenges misconceptions and fosters a more nuanced understanding of global development.
